    "If you have any questions, please let me know. That has to be the fastest sentence I can type as I am always doing it. Should I continue on with this quiz tailoring everything to my skill set or should I start adding in parentheses and other symbols to throw the speed off?",
    `"What you don't know can't hurt you?" Really? Tell that to the dinosaurs. I'm certain they didn't know about that asteroid. Otherwise they would've taken shelter.`,
    `Driving out, into the sun, let the ultraviolet cover me up. Went looking for a creation myth, ended up with a pair of cracked lips. Windows down, scream along to some America-first rock country song. A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall, slot machines, fear of god. Windows down, heater on, big bolts of lightning hanging low. Over the coast, everyone's convinced it's a government drone or alien spaceship. Either way, we're not alone. I'll find a new place to be from.`,
    `To tell you the truth... I worry too much about what others think of me. I hate that side of me. That's why I didn't want anyone to get to know me. I wanted to hide that side of myself. I hate it. "Squall is an unfriendly, introverted guy." It made it easy for me when people perceived me that way. That's a secret between you and me. Got that?`,
    `When the world falls down around you and hope is lost. When you find yourself alone amid a flightless place, look to the distance, know that I am there... and that I watch over you always.`,
    `Be sad. Be mad. Be frustrated. Scream. Cry. Sulk. When you wake up you will think it was just a nightmare only to realize it's all too real. You will be angry and wish for the day back, but reality gives you nothing back and nor should you. `,
    `Do not fall in love with people like me. I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments, and kiss you in every beautiful place, so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth. I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible. And when I leave you will finally understand, why storms are named after people.`,
    `I know it's not good to be weak and helpless, but I don't think it's good to be too strong either. In our society, they talk about survival of the fittest. But we're not animals. We're human.`,
    `You're not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.`,
    `If you find yourself at your wit's end, take it out and see what happens. Maybe your prayers will be answered, and all your problems will disappear in the blink of an eye.`,
    `We all have someone that we never speak of. Someone who meant so much, that even hearing their name makes your soul tremble with memories and pain. Someone who makes your heart break a little more each time you accidentally think of the color of their eyes.`,
    `If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.`,
    `Sometimes when things get rough, I go to my room and cry. I have a fear of commitment and sometimes I fear of losing the person that I love so much. I hate being alone and sometimes when I am alone I fear of not being alone.`,
    `Love is a very special thing. A smile, a tear, a soft summer rain. It has no beginning, it has no end. But I like it best when it's shared with a friend.`,
